    "# Lab 1: Working with OpenAI API and Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "And now comes the fun part!!! Let's get our hands dirty with calling the ChatGPT models using code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to create various AI-powered applications. We'll explore how to structure prompts, understand API responses, and evaluate model outputs using reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Set up and configure the OpenAI API with proper authentication\n",
    "- Create effective prompts for different use cases\n",
    "- Process and display AI-generated responses\n",
    "- Compare standard chat models with reasoning models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important Note** for Windows users:\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to activate your virtual environment, you may run into an error looking something like this \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ai_env\\Scripts\\activate : File C:\\Users\\<username>\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\ai-engineering\\ai_env\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is because by default, Microsoft disables the ability to execute the scripts. To overcome this, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. open up PowerShell (terminal)\n",
    "2. Run the following command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`\n",
    "3. Close and re-open PowerShell (restart your machine if you have to)\n",
    "4. Try activating the environment again by:\n",
    "    - Navigating to the root directory of the project (the ai-engineering folder)\n",
    "    - Run `ai_env/Scripts/Activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you still aren't able to overcome the issue, please follow the instructions in the [README](../../../README.md) to either raise an issue on GitHub or contact me via email or on the SDS platform."
